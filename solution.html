                <strong>Your engineers should be free</strong> to spend their days iterating on product.  It shouldn't cost you engineering resources each time a product manager/investor/nontechnical cofounder/product marketer has a new question about user behavior.  Schmetrics gives these stakeholders the tools they need to get their own questions answered, and we teach them to fish.

                <strong>You can get a lot of things out of the box</strong> from great analytics services like KISSmetrics, Google Analytics, Chartbeat, and Mixpanel.  We're straight-up ninjas at deploying these services to the advantage of our clients, and our backend integrates with them handily.

                <strong>But these products can't do it all.</strong>  While they're each terrific in a variety of general cases, product-specific questions tend to necessitate product-specific solutions.  To that end, Schmetrics has built a kickass analytics warehouse based on events and event handlers, utilizing MongoDB to scale effortlessly with your site.  We deliver custom end-to-end implementations with turnaround times as low as one week: we're not a BigCo firm, and we're not here to waste your time.  We're here to get actionable insights to your stakeholders <strong>as soon as possible</strong>.
